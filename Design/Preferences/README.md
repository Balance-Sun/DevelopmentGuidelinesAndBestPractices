Allow your application to save preferences in a user selectable location i.e. the Dropbox, Google Drive, Copy or iCloud Drive folder.
Similarly like you are probably already syncing all your browser bookmarks etc. and you probably have more than one Mac and i-device, so why not also make it possible for your users to sync your application too! It is very convenient for users who like to customize apps, specially if an app has many options!

See the example screenshots from Alfred.app and Dash.app applications.

• Alfred.app allows you to sync its settings :-)

• Dash.app only allows you to sync snippets, but it would be nice to be able to sync everything else too!

• If you use CocoaPods or hang out at GitHub you can find many open source libraries for doing just this kind of thing for you.
