Allow your application to save preferences/settings in a user selectable location i.e. Dropbox/Google Drive/Copy folder.
Just like you can and are probably already syncing all your browser bookmarks etc. and you probably have more than one Mac, so why not also make it possible for your users to sync your application too!

See the example screenshots from Alfred.app and Dash.app applications.

• Alfred.app allows you to sync its settings :-)

• Dash.app only allows you to sync snippets, but it would be nice to be able to sync everything else too!
